# SVGPresent

## Motivation:

SVG has many interesting features that make it an ideal presentation format:
- No extra/dedicated program needed for display: web browsers on mobile/laptop/desktop all display SVGs natively
  - Can be displayed inline in web pages, and go to full screen, all without downloading
- Open format, XML based
  - Easy to share slides, cut-and-paste content
  - Can create/edit directly, or with sophisticated graphics editors
- Content scales beautifully to any display size, without pixelation
- Small file sizes, easy to share
- Contains advanced animation possibilities in the language, without add-ons

## Demonstration:

Unfortunately, GitHub sanitizes embedded content for security reasons and so the slide decks cant be included directly
here. Instead they have to be displayed from a remote server:

![Slide deck 0](https://timsmithch.github.io/SVG/slider_basic0.svg "Most basic slide deck")

Clicking on the right half of slide advances to the next slide
Clikcing on the left half of slide returns to previous slide
